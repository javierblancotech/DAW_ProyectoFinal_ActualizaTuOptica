# DAW_ProyectoFinal_ActualizaTuOptica
Proyecto Final de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web - Actualiza tu Optica - Tienda Online

"The project presented, with the name “Unpgrade your Optician”, is a web application developed thanks to languages such as PHP 🐘, JavaScript 🟨, and SQL 🛢️
 with the Model View Controller (MVC) 🏗️ design pattern. Here, we will create a Virtual Store or e-commerce 🛒 for the optician 👓 where I currently work and,
 that over time we will try to deploy in other retail optics 🕶️ where an online store has not yet been established. To be able to offer retail visibility on the web 🌐
 to compete in this new digital world 🌍."
